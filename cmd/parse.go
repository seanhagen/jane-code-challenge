var parseCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "parse path/to/match-data.txt",
	Short: "Read and parse match data to produce rankings",
	Long: `A win is worth 3 points for the winner, a loss is worth no points to the
loser, and a tie is worth 1 point for each team.

The only expected argument is a path to a file that contains match results.

The file format is as follows:
 1. Each line represents a match:
   - Each match is on a single line
   - Each match is defined as "<team name> <score>, <team name> <score>"
   - <team name> is a string of any length
   - <score> is the score that team had at the end of the game, as a number

 2. The lines should be in date order -- when the program finds a team that has
    already played in a match day it considers that the end of the day and starts
    a new match day to begin tracking.

    An input file with the following contents:
     Team A 1, Team B 2
     Team C 2, Team D 2
     Team A 2, Team D 1
     Team C 1, Team B 0
    Would produce two days, each with two matches.

    On the other hand, a file with the contents:
     Team A 1, Team B 2
     Team A 2, Team D 1
     Team C 1, Team B 0
    Would produce two days, but day one would have just a single match ( A vs B ).`,
